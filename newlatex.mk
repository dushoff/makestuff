## Current situation is a mess. 
## Right now we can't include any tex files, because latexdeps will create direct dependencies that we don't know how to fill
## Need to decide what to do about inclusions from other directories before we address this. I'm thinking now to simply change latexdeps to get the right (indirect) dependency, but _only_ when no path is given.

latex = pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode

include $(ms)/perl.def
include $(wildcard .deps/*.d)

define ltx
	-/bin/cp -f $*.aux .$*.aux
	$(latex) $*; sleep 1
	diff .$*.aux $*.aux > /dev/null || touch $*.aux
endef

### Making the dependency files. We always want to include them, but don't want make to chain and try to make them.

### Make ./%.deps in the current directory, to be examined when we need it, and deleted otherwise. Hopefully, make can delete it automatically unless we ask for it explicitly
