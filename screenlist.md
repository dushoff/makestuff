Notes on how the screenlist works

Not very clear. There's lots of complexity from the beginning which I no longer use. Basically, things with numbers are meant to be active, and things without numbers are "resting". A number means that you get a screen by default, and are sunk by default. The magic word NOALL can be used to add a directory to the screen without syncing it automatically
