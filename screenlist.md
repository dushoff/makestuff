Notes on how the screenlist works

Everything below the horizontal rule is resting: if we move things down there more often, we'll do less alling (which could also be bad if we work on things that are down there). There is also a NOALL magic word that can be added to things about the horizontal rule (in case they group logically with other stuff)
