In-process notes about using newtalk. Building from stat744, based on working stuff in statistics_talks

* Enable newtalk (+def), texdeps, perl.def
* Figure out what figure directories you need and how to link them (modules, hybrid, webpix ...)

* Boom! (nice)

* local.txt.format: add (if you have content) or Ignore
